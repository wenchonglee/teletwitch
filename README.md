> Work in progress

Webapp to convert 3rd party Twitch emotes (e.g. 7tv) to Telegram sticker sets.

Limitations:

- Telegram video stickers must be lesser than 3 seconds, so emotes longer than 3 seconds will not work.
- Telegram video stickers must also be lesser than 256KB, which may not work for some emotes unless we can compress it well enough
